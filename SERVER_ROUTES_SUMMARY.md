# Server Routes Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Complete Server Routes Implementation

### âœ… Authentication Server Routes
- **POST** `/api/auth/login` - User login with session creation
- **POST** `/api/auth/logout` - User logout with session clearing  
- **POST** `/api/auth/register` - User registration with auto-login
- **GET** `/api/auth/session` - Get current session information

### âœ… Profile Management Server Routes
- **GET** `/api/profile` - Get current user profile
- **PUT** `/api/profile` - Update user profile with automatic session refresh
- **POST** `/api/profile/change-password` - Change user password

### âœ… Ticket Management Server Routes
- **GET** `/api/tickets` - List user tickets with pagination and filtering
- **POST** `/api/tickets` - Create new support ticket
- **GET** `/api/tickets/[id]` - Get specific ticket details
- **POST** `/api/tickets/[id]/comments` - Add comment to ticket

### âœ… Shipment Management Server Routes
- **GET** `/api/shipments` - List user shipments
- **POST** `/api/shipments` - Create new shipment
- **POST** `/api/shipments/calculate-price` - Calculate shipment pricing

## ðŸ”’ Security Improvements

### Before (Direct API Calls)
```javascript
// Access tokens exposed in client-side code
const response = await $fetch('/users/me', {
  baseURL: config.public.apiBaseUrl,
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${user.value?.access_token}` // ðŸš¨ Exposed!
  }
})
```

### After (Server Routes)
```javascript
// Clean, secure server-side handling
const response = await $fetch('/api/profile') // âœ… Secure!
```

## ðŸš€ Performance & Maintainability Benefits

1. **Centralized Authentication**: All auth logic handled server-side
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error responses
3. **Request Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
4. **Session Management**: Automatic session updates after profile changes
5. **Cleaner Client Code**: Simplified frontend API calls
6. **Better Security**: Tokens never exposed to client-side
7. **Future Caching**: Easy to add server-side caching later

## ðŸ“± Updated Frontend Pages

### âœ… Authentication Pages
- **login.vue**: Uses `/api/auth/login`
- **register.vue**: Uses `/api/auth/register` with auto-login
- **NavBar.vue**: Uses `/api/auth/logout`

### âœ… Profile Management
- **profile.vue**: Uses `/api/profile` and `/api/profile/change-password`

### âœ… Ticket Management
- **tickets/index.vue**: Uses `/api/tickets`
- **tickets/create.vue**: Uses `/api/tickets` 
- **tickets/[id].vue**: Uses `/api/tickets/[id]` and `/api/tickets/[id]/comments`

### âœ… Shipment Management
- **shipments/create.vue**: Uses `/api/shipments` and `/api/shipments/calculate-price`
- **dashboard.vue**: Uses `/api/shipments` and `/api/tickets` for recent data

### âœ… Public Pages
- **track/[tracking_number].vue**: Uses `/api/tracking/[tracking_number]`
